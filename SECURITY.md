## Reporting a Vulnerability

## What You Should Report

If you are wondering what counts as a vulnerability, heres a good list:

-   The ability to execute arbitrary code on the server hosting Anura (not in Anura itself, as this is an intended feature)
-   The ability to crash Anura (As in for everyone, not just your browser session)
